# USOPython
Python script using openpyxl for reading and generating USO Propsal Review excel document. Given the task of having to
parse through a massive excel document and generate a report based on it's dating I decided to do it using a python script.
It's not pretty but it works. What normally would take me 10+ hours of manual copying, calculating and pasting is done in
~5seconds thanks to the openpyxl library.
